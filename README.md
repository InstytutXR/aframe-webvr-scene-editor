# aframe-webvr-scene-editor
A continuously WIP experiment using A-Frame to create WebVR scenes in VR Mode

## Introduction

### Info

‚ùì Designing for VR is different than designing for flat experiences.

**1 unit = 1 meter**

Enter VR mode and play with primitives to populate the scene and **learn how important designing at actual scale is!**

------------

### Updates

‚ö†Ô∏è This is the very 1st prototype as a POC. The current version of my **aframe-webvr-scene-editor** is designed for **Oculus Go** (and other 3DOF devices).

### Credits

The locomotion method in my **aframe-webvr-scene-editor** experiment relies on the [aframe-extras / movement-controls](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-extras/tree/master/src/controls "aframe-extras / movement-controls") component created by Don McCurdy.

üôè Thank you for your amazing work, Don!
